Saturday Oct 19th Goals

1. Basic routing complete for charts, search, profile pagek -  COMPLETED

2. Set up api service - COMPLETED V1

3. Get some data to appear in the charts page (no actual chart.js yet) - BLOCKED by console ERROR TypeError: "_co.onClick is not a function"
Number 3. fixed as of Monday Oct 21st after correctly importing api.service into the charts component

4. Mess around with Charts.js
Still trying to get the chart data into a workable format. Challenge is the keys of the time series is dynamic and changes
with each request, each day. 
*Note - the trading window is 09:35:00 to 16:00:00 week days only (i.e. 9:35am to 4pm)
October 26th successfully have chart data saving to an array. Still need to figure out 
how to import chart.js into my app and use it. The docs could use more diving into.
Otherwise search for another charting library.
ASK SEAN FOR HELP!

5. Focus on Search api: Objective is to have the following reqs:
    -Type a company name into an input, hit search
    -List of stock symbols appear matching directly or closely to the company name entered
    -Should have ability to add a stock to a favorites List
    -later if I have time add the ability for krypto too
